# About Board Game Clubs UK

Board Game Clubs UK is a free, community-maintained directory of board game clubs in Yorkshire and beyond. Our goal is simple: help people find their nearest board game club on an interactive map.

## How It Works

- Browse the [map]({{ "/" | relative_url }}) to find clubs near you
- Filter by day of the week or search by name and location
- Click on a club to see full details including venue, time, cost, and links
- Use "Find my location" to sort clubs by distance from you

## Community Maintained

All club data is stored as individual files in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BoardGameClubs/BoardGameClubs_Web). Anyone can submit a pull request to add a new club or update existing information. See our [contribution guide]({{ "/contribute" | relative_url }}) for details.

## No Accounts, No Tracking

Board Game Clubs UK is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. There are no user accounts, no cookies, and no analytics tracking. The interactive map uses OpenStreetMap, which is free and open source.

## Get Involved

Know a board game club that's not listed? [Add it to the directory]({{ "/contribute" | relative_url }}) by submitting a pull request on GitHub. It only takes a few minutes.
